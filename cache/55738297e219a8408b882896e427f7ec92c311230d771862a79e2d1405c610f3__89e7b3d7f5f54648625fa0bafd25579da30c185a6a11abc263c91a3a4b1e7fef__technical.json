  "comparison": "Both papers focus on the challenges of developing deep learning systems, specifically in the context of software engineering. Paper 1 focuses on analyzing questions on Stack Overflow to identify common challenges in developing deep learning applications, while Paper 2 conducts interpretive research with companies to identify challenges in development, production, and organizational aspects of deep learning systems.\n\nIn terms of methods, Paper 1 utilizes manual inspection, automated classification, and root cause analysis of deep learning questions on Stack Overflow. The authors analyze a large number of questions to categorize common programming issues and root causes. On the other hand, Paper 2 conducts interpretive research with companies of different sizes to identify challenges in development, production, and organizational aspects of deep learning systems. The research involves collaborating with companies on seven projects to understand the main challenges faced in building high-quality deep learning systems.\n\nFrom a technical approach perspective, Paper 1 delves into specific technical issues such as API misuse, incorrect hyperparameter selection, GPU computation, and static graph computation. The paper provides detailed insights into the root causes of programming challenges in deep learning applications. In contrast, Paper 2 focuses on broader challenges such as hidden technical debt, boundary erosion, entanglement, hidden feedback loops, undeclared consumers, data dependencies, and configuration issues. The paper highlights the organizational challenges and complexities involved in integrating deep learning technology into products.\n\nIn terms of conclusions, both papers emphasize the importance of understanding and addressing the challenges in developing deep learning systems. Paper 1 suggests the need for better tool performance support and techniques for debugging and profiling machine learning systems. Paper 2 emphasizes the collaboration between the software engineering and deep learning communities to address challenges in building production-ready deep learning systems.\n\nOverall, while both papers address challenges in developing deep learning systems, Paper 1 focuses more on technical programming issues, while Paper 2 takes a broader organizational perspective on the challenges faced in integrating deep learning technology into products. Both papers provide valuable insights into the complexities and considerations involved in developing high-quality deep learning systems.",
